Assignment: 
Build a Simple Next.js App with Google Authentication (NextAuth) and Material UI
Objective:
Your task is to build a Next.js app with Google Authentication using NextAuth, styled using Material UI, and deployed to Vercel. You will also integrate Git and set up a new GitHub repository to manage your version control. You will implement Material UI’s Menu component for the navigation functionality.

Assignment Tasks:
1.	Initialize a new Next.js App Router inside /Dokumenty folder named: pisomka1-meno-priezvisko .
2.	Set-up Git repository for your project
3.	Push your project to a new GitHub repository named: pisomka1-meno-priezvisko.
4.	Google Authentication Using NextAuth:
    o   Set up Google Authentication using NextAuth.
    o	Use Google OAuth for the sign-in process.
    o	Create the following pages:
        	Home Page: Displays a welcome message to authenticated users and prompts unauthenticated users to sign in.
        	Sign-In Page: Use Google OAuth for authentication.
        	Sign-Out Page: Allow users to sign out.
    o	Ensure that user information (e.g., name, email) is displayed after signing in.
5.	Material UI Integration:
    o	Use Material UI to style the app, including the form elements, buttons, and Menu for navigation.
    o	Implement a Menu component (instead of a NavBar) that adapts to the user's authentication status (signed in or signed out).
6.	Deploy to new Vercel project

Project Requirements:
1.	Home Page:
    o	The home page should display different content depending on whether the user is authenticated or not.
    o	If the user is authenticated, display a personalized message with their Google profile information.
    o	If the user is not authenticated, prompt them to sign in with a Google account.
2.	Sign-In Page:
    o	The sign-in page should use Google OAuth for signing in.
    o	Use a Material UI button with a Google icon for the sign-in process.
3.	Sign-Out Page:
    o	The sign-out page should allow the user to sign out and confirm that the process was successful.
4.	Menu Navigation:
    o	Implement a Menu component that adapts based on the user's authentication status.
    o	Use the Material UI Menu component to display different options based on whether the user is signed in or not:
